RedKite CMS Practical Manual - Part 1
=====================================

RedKite CMS Practical Manual shows all the functionalities of the CMS, and allows you to work 
directly on a real website. To to do this, you need to `install RedKite CMS`_ before 
starting.

This manual is in two parts and it has been written to be as simple and direct as possible. 
Almost every operation has an illustration showing you what you to need to do.

After completing the tutorial you will be able to:

    1. Add, edit, remove blocks
    2. Add, edit, remove list of blocks
    3. Add and move through pages

The time needed to complete the whole tutorial is estimated in one hour. 

The first part of the tutorial is focused on blocks management.


Edit a block
------------
Editing a block is really simple: just click on an editable block to open the editor.
Let's see this operation in detail.

Image block
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: //bundles/alphalemonwebsite/media/bootbusiness/img1.jpg

Place the cursor over the first product's image and left click into the image's area to open the editor.

.. image:: //bundles/alphalemonwebsite/media/bootbusiness/img2.jpg

Click into the src input box to open the **media library**. This tool allows you to manage each
type of file on your website.

Upload an image. I've already uploaded the images bundled with the bootbusiness original 
theme. Next double click on the one you want to insert.

A green alert tells you the image has been added and the images' path is written back 
into the src input box. Close the media library.

Change the Title and Alt information to introduce text to describe
the image. This information is important for SEO.

Click save button to confirm.

Text block
~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: //bundles/alphalemonwebsite/media/bootbusiness/img4.jpg

Place your cursor over the text below the image and left click to edit the content.
Type some text to describe your product, then click the save button to confirm.


Remove a block
--------------

.. image:: //bundles/alphalemonwebsite/media/bootbusiness/img5.jpg

Put your mouse on the button below the text you have just edited and click on the trash icon
to remove the block.

You will be prompted to confirm the operation: click Ok.


Add a new block
---------------

.. image:: //bundles/alphalemonwebsite/media/bootbusiness/img6.jpg

When you remove the last block, RedKite CMS adds a place-holder into the block's area,
which explains that the slot does not contains any content: place the cursor over that 
block and click on the plus icon.

A panel that contains all the available blocks is displayed. Click on the Buttons Group
block to add it into the empty slot.

Manage a list of blocks
-----------------------

.. image:: //bundles/alphalemonwebsite/media/bootbusiness/img8.jpg

Place the cursor near one of the buttons to highlight the block's container, then click
into the block's area.

.. image:: //bundles/alphalemonwebsite/media/bootbusiness/img9.jpg

A red trash icon is displayed under each button and a blue plus icon is added just 
before the first block and under each buttons. The interface has been changed since that
picture has been taken.

Remove an included block from a composite block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: //bundles/alphalemonwebsite/media/bootbusiness/img10.jpg

Now we are going to remove a button. In this case it is not important which button 
is removes, so click one of the trash icons and confirm your choice.

.. image:: //bundles/alphalemonwebsite/media/bootbusiness/img11.jpg

Now place your cursor over the first button and click on it to open the editor.

Type "Buy now" into the "Button text" input and choose "primary" from the "Button type" 
combobox, then click "Save" to confirm.

Do the same with the button next but only change the "Button text" in "Read more".

.. image:: //bundles/alphalemonwebsite/media/bootbusiness/img12.jpg

Place your cursor into the products container's area and click into it.

And an included block into a composite block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: //bundles/alphalemonwebsite/media/bootbusiness/img13.jpg

Click on the plus icon button to add a new product.

.. image:: //bundles/alphalemonwebsite/media/bootbusiness/img14.jpg

Place the cursor over the first product container's area and click into it to open 
the editor to change the product's width.

.. image:: //bundles/alphalemonwebsite/media/bootbusiness/img15.jpg

Choose "span4 (300px)" from the combo box and click the save button.

Now you should repeat the same process for other products and services.
