RedKite CMS tests suite
==========================

Most parts of RedKite CMS have unit and/or functional and/or integrated tests associated 
with them. 

These tests are written using **PHPUnit** and are required when making contributions to all RedKite 
Labs ecosystem. 

You'll always find all the Unit, Integrated and Functional tests in the Tests directory. 
By convention unit tests lives under the **Tests/Unit** folder, integrated ones under the **Tests/Integrated** 
directory and functional are under **Tests/Functional** folder.

To run test suite you need PHPUnit installed on your system. You can find how to install this tool
at http://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/installation.html

Run the tests suite
-------------------

To configure your Symfony2 application to run RedKite CMS test suite you need to configure
the PHPUnit configuration file that comes with the application itself. Usually there is a file called
**phpunit.xml.dist** file placed under the **app** folder.

The best way to add your custom configuration is to copy that file to **phpunit.xml** and 
make your changes to this new file.

We need to change the **bootstrap** parameter, which uses the Symfony2 **bootstrap.php.cache**,
with a new one that comes with RedKite CMS:

.. code:: xml

    <phpunit
        [...]
        bootstrap = "../src/RedKiteLabs/RedKiteCmsBundle/Tests/app_bootstrap.php"

Feel free to give a look to this file, anyway it just configures the **dsn** which points to a
sqlite database created in memory. After that, it loads the standard **bootstrap.php.cache**
file.

.. note::

    This configuration is already present in the RedKite CMS Sandbox.

To run the tests suite, simply run the following command from the top directory of your application:

.. code:: text

    phpunit -c app
    
Test can be run directly from the bundle itself. This is very important to understand because 
RedKite CMS is configured to work with **travis-ci** which is an awesome Continuous Integration 
on-line service.

This means that each time a change is pushed to RedKite CMS repository, the tests suite is executed
at **Travis**, so it is immediately clear if the commit is good or breaks the tests.

For this reason it is important to verify the tests suite in this condition before ask for a
pull request.

Follows these steps to achieve this task:

Clone your RedKite CMS forked repository as follows:

.. code:: text

    git clone [your repository]
    
Download composer 

.. code:: text    

    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

or if you don't have curl:

.. code:: text 

    php -r "eval('?>'.file_get_contents('https://getcomposer.org/installer'));"
    
then run 

.. code:: text

    php composer.phar install --dev

From the top root folder of your cloned repository run:

.. code:: text

    phpunit
    
If everything is correct, ask for your PR.

.. note::

    When RedKite CMS tests suite is executed in this scenario, a basic Symfony2 configuration is
    saved under the **Tests/Functional/app** folder
