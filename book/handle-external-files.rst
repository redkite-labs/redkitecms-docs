Manage assets 
=============

This chapter explains in detail how to manage external assets like images, zip files, 
pdf files and more.


The media library
-----------------
RedKite CMS manages website assets using the awesome Studio42's ElFinder file manager 
for the web.

The most important things you can do with this tool are:

    - Upload files
    - Preview a file
    - Rename a file
    - Delete one or more files
    - Add, rename, delete folders
    - Copy/move files between sub-folders
    
Upload a file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To upload a file click the **Upload files** button on the toolbar

or right click on the background files area and choose the **Upload files** entry 
from the contextual menu.

A window opens and you can choose the file you want to transfer from your hard disk.
You can upload more files a time too.

Rename a file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To rename a file right click on it and choose **Rename** from the contextual menu.

Delete one or more files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To delete one of more files, select them and right click over one of them to open the
contextual menu and choose **Delete** to proceed.

Add, rename, delete folders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a new folder right click on the background files area and choose the **New folder** 
entry from the contextual menu.

.. image:: //bundles/alphalemonwebsite/media/manual/img-27.jpg


This will create a new folder, and selects the default text to let you give it an appropriate 
name.

To rename or delete one or more folders, proceed as you do for files.


Copy/move files between sub-folders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To copy or move one or more files from one folder to another one, select the files, right
click on one of them and select the **Duplicate** command when you want to copy a file or the
Cut / Paste commands when you want to move.

When you want only to move a file or a folder you can use drag and drop too.
