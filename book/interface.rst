RedKite CMS editor interface
============================

This chapter contains an overview of the RedKite CMS editor interface.

The interface
-------------

After you signed in, RedKite CMS redirects to the main page of your website
and loads the editor to manage the whole website.

RedKite CMS is an inline application, this means you can edit your website contents
directly on each page of your website.

When the CMS is started, the home page is loaded and you can start immediately editing it.

The interface has been minimized to have the less impact on page:

Edit contents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To edit contents, simply click on the **Edit** button: this operation makes
the editable blocks active and ready for changes. The edit block toggles to
**Stop**

A **Block** is such a container for a particular kind of content, so we may have
a block that contains an hypertext content, a block that contains an image, a block 
that contains a link and so on. 

Each Block has an appropriate inline editor to change its content.

This topic is covered in detail in the `blocks management`_ chapter.


Navigate through website pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RedKite CMS let you navigate through website pages:

1. Clicking directly on pages internal links
2. Using the **Nav** menu placed under the **Edit** button

This topic is covered in detail in the `navigate through the website`_ chapter.
    
The toolbar
~~~~~~~~~~~

The toolbar is placed at the top of the page and is hidden by default. In the middle
top of the screen there is a small tab with a white down arrow that opens the toolbar
when you click over it.

The toolbar contains all the commands you need to manage the website, like pages, languages,
themes and more. The most of this commands open a panel that scrolls down from the toolbar and
inside this panel there are rendered the interfaces that let you manage the section required.

At last, from the toolbar, you can change the RedKite CMS interface language too.
