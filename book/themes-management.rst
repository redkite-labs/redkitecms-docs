Themes management
=================

This chapter explains in detail how to manage the themes used in your website.


Add a new theme
---------------

Themes could be added to your application in two ways:

1. Create a custom theme
2. Add an existing theme in your composer.json file

To create a custom theme, you should read the `dedicated tutorial`_, while to add an
existing theme to your application using composer, you must follow the instructions 
provided by each third-parties theme.


The user interface
------------------

Open the top toolbar and click on the **Themes** button to open the panel.

The themes panel is divided in two columns, on the left there is rendered
the theme in use and on the right column there are displayed all the available
themes.

Each theme provides information about itself, like the theme name, the author and more. 

While the active theme has any command to interact with, all the available themes
have three commands placed under each theme:

1. Preview
2. Activate
3. Start from this theme
    
Let's explain them in detail.

Preview a theme
---------------

This command let you see the design of a theme as its author has designed it.

To preview a theme simply click on the **Preview** action. The theme is rendered
and on the left you have two commands:

1. Nav
2. Back
    
The **Nav** button hides the theme's templates, so click it to display them and
switch to another template selecting it from the combobox.

The **Back** button returns back to the editor.


Activate a theme
----------------

There is a `detailed tutorial`_ about this topic, so refer to that one to learn 
how to change the website of your theme. 


Start from this theme
----------------

This command completely resets your website and starts from the new theme: click
on the button and confirm the action.
