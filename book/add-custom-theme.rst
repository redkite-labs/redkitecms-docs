Add a custom Theme-App to RedKite CMS
=====================================

This chapter explains how to create a new theme for RedKite CMS.

What is a Theme?
---------------

An RedKite CMS Theme Application could be defined as a collection of twig templates which 
have their own assets like javascripts, stylesheets and images, packaged into a well-known 
structure.

How is a Theme-App structured?
-------------------------

A Theme-App is a standalone Symfony2 bundle. Using this approach has several advantages:

1. It is a Symfony2 Bundle
2. It is reusable in many web sites
3. Assets required by the content are packed into a well known structure

Create the FancyThemeBundle
---------------------------
RedKite CMS has two built-in commands which help to manage a theme:

- **redkitecms:generate:app-theme**
- **redkitecms:generate:templates**

The first command generates a new App-Theme Bundle, the second one generates the templates 
configuration files.

To start a new theme, you must run the **redkitecms:generate:app-theme** command from your console.

This command extends the Symfony's generate:bundle command, so the process should be 
familiar. Run the following command to start:

.. code-block:: text

    php app/rkconsole redkitecms:generate:app-theme --env=rkcms

You'll get the following response:

.. code-block:: text

    Welcome to the Symfony2 bundle generator

    [...]

    Bundle namespace:

Answer as follows:

.. code-block:: text

    Bundle namespace: RedKiteCms/Theme/FancyThemeBundle

The proposed bundle name **must be changed** to FancyThemeBundle otherwise you could
have issues later:

.. code-block:: text

    Bundle name [RedKiteCmsThemeFancyThemeBundle]: FancyThemeBundle

The following options could be left as default values, but you can also change them to fit your needs if you want to.

Do not let Symfony2 update the AppKernel for you, because RedKite CMS will autoload
the theme for you.
	
Finally, you must clear the cache to have the theme auto loaded:

.. code-block:: text

    php app/rkconsole ca:c --env=rkcms
	
Sometimes it might not be enough to do this, and the theme might not be correctly displayed inside
the RedKite CMS themes panel. When that happens you must manually remove the **app/cache** 
folder.

.. note::

    When you are implementing a new theme, you should work in the rkcms_dev environment
    due to templates and assets being regenerated by the framework, otherwise you will have to
    clear cache and run assetic:dump commands continuously.
    
 .. note::
 
    The new theme will only be available after you have configured your templates and executed
    the `redkitecms:generate:templates FancyThemeBundle` command. Read on.
	

Add the twig templates
----------------------

When the theme is created, you must start to add your twig templates to the theme bundle.

The **generate:app-theme** command, added a new **Theme** folder under the **Resources/views**
folder of your App-Theme bundle: your templates must be placed inside that folder.

The Theme folder structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Theme folder could be given the following basic structure:

.. code-block:: text

    views
        Theme
            home.html.twig
            internal.html.twig

This theme has two templates: the **home** and the **internal**. This structure will 
definitely work, but a real world example would probably look be 
like the following:

.. code-block:: text

    Theme
        base
            base.html.twig
        home.html.twig
        internal.html.twig

A base template is added into a sub-folder. This file should contain the common parts 
of the website's layout, while the other two templates will inherit from the base.html.twig file.

The themes configuration generated from that structure consists in two templates
and three slots configuration files. In fact the files saved into the themes root folder 
become a template file, while a slot file is generated for all the templates, plus one
named **base.xml**. This last file contains the common slots.

Don't worry about the generation process for now, because it is explained in greater detail 
in the next paragraphs.

You might need to add more separation to templates, so your theme structure could look 
like the following:

.. code-block:: text

    Theme
        base
            base.html.twig
        support
            template_a.html.twig
            template_b.html.twig
        home.html.twig
        internal.html.twig
        internal_1.html.twig

in this case the home template inherits from the **template_a.html.twig** and 
the other internal templates from the **template_b.html.twig**. The templates inside
the support folder inherit from the **base.html.twig** template.

In this case if the support templates contain repeated slots, these are merged with 
those found into the **base.html.twig** and all of them are saved into the **base.xml** 
configuration file. 

The design
~~~~~~~~~~

RedKite CMS uses **twig** as its template engine, so when you have converted the templates 
to html from your design, you must then adapt them to twig.

Clean the template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First of all, templates do not need the header section since it is inherited by the 
base twig template provided by the CMS, or from another custom one. 

Lets suppose your template looks like this one:

.. code-block:: html

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title></title>
            <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
            <link href="stylesheets/screen.css" media="screen, projection" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheets/960.css" />
        </head>
        <body>
            <div id="header">           
                <div id="logo"><img src="" /></div>
            </div>       
            <div id="contents"> 
                <h1>My title</h1>
                <p>Lorem ipsum...</p>         
            </div>       
            <div id="footer">
                <p>Lorem ipsum...</p> 
            </div>
        </body>
    </html>
	
you must only save the following code:

.. code-block:: html

    <div id="header">           
        <div id="logo">
            <a href="#"><img src="images/logo.png" title="Download RedKite CMS" alt="" /></a>
        </div>
    </div>       
    <div id="contents"> 
        <h1>My title</h1>
        <p>Lorem ipsum...</p>         
    </div>       
    <div id="footer">
        <p>Lorem ipsum...</p> 
    </div>
	
and save it into a twig template.

The twig template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create a new twig template file called **home.html.twig** under the **Resources/views/Theme** 
folder. Open it and add the following code:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    {% extends base_template %}

    {% block body %}
    {% endblock %}

The template must extend the template defined by the ThemeEngineBundle's **base_template** 
parameter. This template must have a body **block** where the contents saved from the 
html template you are creating must be placed:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    {% block body %}
        <div id="header">           
            <div id="logo">
                <a href="#"><img src="images/logo.png" title="Download RedKite CMS" alt="" /></a>
            </div>
        </div>       
        <div id="contents"> 
            <h1>My title</h1>
            <p>Lorem ipsum...</p>         
        </div>       
        <div id="footer">
            <p>Lorem ipsum...</p> 
        </div>
    {% endblock %}

You can easily change this template just by defining a new parameter in both `config.yml` and
`config_rkcms.yml`:

.. code-block:: text

    red_kite_labs_theme_engine:
        # ...
        base_template: MyAwesomeBundle:Theme:my-base.html.twig

this because RedKite CMS does not inherit its configuration from Symfony2 configuration.
		
.. note::

    When you redefine the base template, be sure to redefine all the sections defined
    into the one that comes with RedKite CMS.

The slots
~~~~~~~~~

Now you must identify the slots on the template. A **slot** is an html tag that 
contains the content you want to edit. Each content contained inside a slot is saved into 
a Block. Look at the following code taken from the original template:

.. code-block:: html

    <div id="header">
        <div id="logo">
            <a href="#"><img src="images/logo.png" title="Download RedKite CMS" alt="" /></a>
        </div>
    </div>
    [...]

The content we will edit with RedKite CMS is the one contained inside **the logo div**. 
This content must be replaced as follows: 

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    <div id="header">
        <div id="logo">
            {{ block('logo') }}
        </div>
    </div>
    [...]

Here we have declared a new block called **logo** 

This block must be declared inside a file which contains all the template's slots.

The html id attribute assigned to the slot is not mandatory, so you and call it if you wish, but 
it is best practice to name the slots id and the slot name in the same way.

Another best practice to follow is to use the **renderSlot** function inside a **div** tag, 
so avoid to writing something like this:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    <p id="logo">
        {{ renderSlot('logo') }}
    </p>
	
The slot file
-------------

Add a new **Slots** folder under the **Resources/views** folder and create a new
**slots.html.twig** template inside it. Open that file and add the following code
inside:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% block logo %}
        {{ renderSlot('logo') }}
    {% endblock %}

We have defined the **logo block** called in the template. This block contains a 
RedKite CMS built-in twig function called **renderSlot**, which renders all the blocks
contained into a slot.

This function requires the name of the slot passed as a string as argument. While it
is not mandatory, the slot name should be the same as that of the block.

That instruction in not enough to correctly define your slot. You must also define
some attributes for the slot.
	
Define the slot attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must define some attributes for the slot, simply adding a twig comment just below 
the **renderSlot** statement:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    {% block logo %}
        {# BEGIN-SLOT
            name: logo
            repeated: site
            htmlContent: |
                <a href="#"><img src="images/logo.png" title="Download RedKite CMS" alt="" /></a>
        END-SLOT #}
        {{ renderSlot('logo') }}
    {% endblock %}

This section requires a careful explanation. Each attribute section must start with the **BEGIN-SLOT** 
directive and it must be closed by the **END-SLOT** directive.

Attributes must be written in valid **yml** syntax. Yml requires a perfect indentation, 
so the first line defines the indentation for the other attributes:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    {# BEGIN-SLOT
        name: logo
          repeated: site
        htmlContent: |
            <a href="#"><img src="images/logo.png" title="Download RedKite CMS" alt="" /></a>
    END-SLOT #}

The code above will return an error because the second attribute has a wrong indentation. When
this happens, the section is skipped and the service is not instantiated.

The **name** option is mandatory and if it is omitted, RedKite CMS will skip the slot.

Additional optional arguments
------------------------------

You can define some other attributes in addition to **name** option:

1. blockType
2. htmlContent
3. repeated
4. blockDefinition

The blockType option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Defines the block type that RedKite CMS must add for that slot when a new page is added. 
By default, the block type added is **Text**.


The htmlContent option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **htmlContent** option overrides the default content added by the block, so when 
you want to use the default value, simply don't declare this option.


The blockDefinition option (Since RedKite CMS 1.1.2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **blockDefinition** option overrides the values of the Block's properties. For example
an Image block is defined by the following **json** structure;

.. code-block:: text

    {
        "0" : {
            "src": "",
            "data_src": "holder.js/260x180",
            "title" : "%s",
            "alt" : "%s".
            "class" : ""
        }
    }

To change the value of some properties, you can define the **blockDefinition** attribute 
as follows:

.. code-block:: text

    blockDefinition:
        0:
            data_src: holder.js/700x250
            class: img-responsive img-home-portfolio


You can change the definition for a more complex Block, defining how included blocks
must be initialized. Here's a definition for a **BootstrapNavbarBlock**:

.. code-block:: text

    blockDefinition:
        inverted: navbar-inverse  
        items: 
            0:
                blockType: BootstrapNavbarMenuBlock
                alignment: navbar-right
                items: 
                    0:
                        blockType: Link
                        0:
                            value: About
                    1:
                        blockType: Link
                        0:
                            value: Services
                    2:
                        blockType: Link
                        0:
                            value: Contact
      

The repeated option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most of the contents displayed on a web page are repeated through the website pages. 
For example the site logo is usually the same for all the site's pages, while a navigation 
menu can be the same for a specific language.

The repeated option manages this behaviour and repeats the content for the blocks 
that live on a slot. The possible values for this option are:

1. page (default)
2. language
3. site

When this argument is not declared, a block repeated at page level is added.

None of them is required, but when you don't need to specify any attribute however, you must 
be sure to define this section:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    {# BEGIN-SLOT
        name: logo
    END-SLOT #}	

Use the slots file
------------------

You need to include the slots file inside your template to have the slots available.
This operation is achieved adding a use statement just under the **extend** statement:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    {% extends base_template %}

    {% use 'FancyThemeBundle:Slots:slots.html.twig' %}
	
    {% block body %}
        <div id="header">           
            <div id="logo">
                {{ block('logo') }}
            </div>
        </div> 
        [...]
    {% endblock %}

Define the template assets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each template comes with one or more external assets, like javascript and stylesheet files,
which must be added to the template adapted to work with RedKite CMS.

The base layout used to render each page provides several sections which can be extended in a
template to add extra assets to the page.

There is a `cookbook entry`_ which covers this topic in detail.

Create the templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When your templates are ready, you may run the command which creates the services in 
the Dependency Injector Container:

.. code-block:: text

    redkitecms:generate:templates FancyThemeBundle --env=rkcms

This command will generate the config files that define the theme's templates and their 
slots. If something goes wrong, a notice is displayed.

Overriding a template
---------------------

To override the template of an existing Theme, you must create a new folder named with 
the theme you want to use, for example **AwesomeThemeBundle**, under the **app/Resources/views** 
folder of your application, than add a new template under that folder, called as the 
one you want to override, for example **home.twig.html**. 

Open that template and add the following code:

.. code-block:: jinja

    // app/Resources/views/AwesomeThemeBundle/home.html.twig
    {% extends 'AwesomeThemeBundle:Theme:home.html.twig' %}

    {% block logo %}
        {{ block('new_logo') }}
    {% endblock %}

This code overrides the **AwesomeThemeBundle's home.html.twig** template, replacing the 
**logo** slot with the contents saved in the **new_logo** slot.
